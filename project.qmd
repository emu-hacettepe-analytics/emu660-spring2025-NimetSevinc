# 1. Project Overview and Scope

> Energy production and consumption are among the primary drivers of climate change, as they are major sources of carbon emissions. The continuous rise in energy demand, fueled by economic growth and industrialization, directly accelerates carbon emissions. In this study, we aim to investigate the relationship between energy consumption and carbon emissions originating from the energy sector in Turkey over the years.
>
> First, correlation and regression analyses will be conducted to reveal the linear relationship between energy consumption and carbon emissions. Then, time series analysis will be applied to evaluate the trends of emissions and energy consumption over the years, the sectoral distribution of carbon emissions from the energy sector will also be examined, with a particular focus on emissions from electricity generation due to its dominant share.\
> Additionally, the relationships between key indicators—such as energy intensity (primary energy consumption/GDP), per capita energy consumption, and per capita carbon emissions—will be analyzed to assess the potential for decoupling carbon emissions from economic growth.

## 2.2 General Information About Data

The data obtained from TÜİK provide information on the sectoral distribution of carbon emissions in Türkiye over the years, as well as GDP figures necessary for calculating energy intensity. Additionally, the data gathered from the IEA include Türkiye's total primary energy supply, annual energy amounts by source, energy-related carbon emissions, the carbon intensity of the energy mix, per capita carbon emissions, electricity generation and consumption figures, and the share of renewable energy sources in electricity generation.

## 2.3 Reason of Choice

This study has been selected with the aim of contributing to sustainable development goals in line with energy and climate policies.\
In order to shed light on the extent to which carbon-free growth is achievable and how Turkey's trends over the years align with these goals, this topic has been chosen from the perspectives of energy, environment, and society, particularly given that energy-related emissions constitute a major portion of global warming.\
Raising awareness on this issue is also one of the primary motivations behind the study.

# 3. Analysis

In the first stage of this section, exploratory data analysis was conducted to better understand the details of the data. The datasets prepared for the analysis were visualized to make them interpretable and suitable for drawing insights. After understanding the data details and their relationships, time series and regression analyses were applied to make predictions about CO2 emissions.

## 3.1 Exploratory Data Analysis

When examining the change in CO2 emissions over the years, an increasing trend is observed. Population growth also plays a role in this rise.

Emissions from the electricity sector have increased significantly, reaching the highest levels among all sectors. This is followed by the transportation and industry sectors, both with high emission values. Emissions related to the residential sector have increased at a slower pace. Emission values in other sectors remain relatively low.

The change in total carbon emissions over the years in Turkey has been analyzed along with the trend line.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

emissions_by_sector |> ggplot(aes(x=Year, y=Total)) + geom_line(color="blue", size=2) + theme_minimal() + ggtitle("Total CO2 Emissions Over the Years") + ylab("Total Emission") + geom_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE, color="red", size=0.5)
```

We observe that the industrial sector is the largest consumer of electricity. The residential and commercial sectors also have high levels of electricity consumption. In recent years, with the increasing use of electric vehicles, small increases have been observed in the transportation sector. In contrast, almost no increase has been seen in the agriculture and fisheries sectors. The low electricity consumption in these two sectors despite population growth may indicate a decline in their operational capacity.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

master_data <- master_data |> filter(!is.na(`CO2 emissions per capita`))

ggplot(master_data,aes(x = Year, y = `CO2 emissions per capita`)) +
  geom_line(color = "darkred") +
  labs(title = "CO2 Emissions Per Capita (tCO2)", x = "Year", y = "tCO2") +
  theme_calc()
```

The annual distribution of energy sources used for electricity generation has changed as follows:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggstream)
library(streamgraph)
library(plotly)

```

The percentage change in emissions by sector is as follows:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

emissions_by_sector <-master_data |> group_by(Year) |> pivot_longer(cols = Energy:Waste,
                            names_to = "Emissions_sector",
                            values_to = "Value") |> mutate(Percentage = Value/sum(Value)*100)

plot_ly(emissions_by_sector,
        labels = ~Emissions_sector,
        values = ~Value,
        frame = ~Year,
        type = 'pie',
        textinfo = 'percent',
        insidetextorientation = 'radial') 
```

Strong correlation results have shown that as the population increases, CO₂ emissions from fuel sources also rise. Additionally, as per capita electricity consumption increases, per capita CO₂ emissions also increase. A strong positive relationship has been observed between electricity generation and economic growth (GDP).\
The share of renewable energy sources has not shown a directly negative relationship with other variables in the system at this stage. This may be due to its relatively low share in total energy usage.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(ggcorrplot)
veri <- master_data[,c("mid_year_population",
                      "value_usd",
                      "CO2 emissions from fuel combustion",
                      "CO2 emissions per capita",
                      "Electricity consumption per capita (MWh)",
                      "Total electricity production (GWh)",
                      "Modern renewables(%)",
                      "Renewables share of electricity generation (%)")] 

core_1 <-cor(veri, use="complete.obs")



kisaltma <- c("Population","GDP","CO2 From Fuel","CO2 Per Capita","Electricity Use Per Capita", "Electricity Production Total","Modern RE Share Final Energy","Renewables Share Electricity")

colnames(core_1) <- kisaltma
rownames(core_1) <- kisaltma

ggcorrplot(core_1,lab=T,lab_size=3,type="lower",tl.cex=8,tl.srt=45) 
```

The heatmap below shows the correlations between per capita CO₂ emissions and electricity generation sources. The graph indicates a very high correlation coefficient between coal and CO₂ emissions, suggesting that coal use in electricity production is one of the main contributors to the increase in emissions. Renewable sources such as wind, geothermal, and hydro also show a positive correlation. However, this may not be due to their direct contribution to emissions, but rather because their increasing share in electricity production coincides with an overall rise in total generation and emissions. A negative correlation is observed for oil (r = –0.88). Since oil has a relatively small share in electricity production, its reduction has little effect on decreasing total emissions.

**Electricity Generation&Carbon Emissions Relation**

The chart presents the amount of carbon emissions (tCO₂/MWh) generated per unit of electricity production (MWh) by different energy sources used in electricity generation in Turkey. These emission factors serve as important indicators in the context of energy policy.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

> In this regression model, the relationship between electricity generation from coal and total carbon emissions is examined. Every 1,000 GWh of coal-based electricity generation corresponds to approximately 3 MtCO₂ of emissions.

Çoklu regresyon modelinde kömür üretiminin artışı açık şekilde emisyonu artırıyor, yenilenebilir enerjinin katsayısı negatif yani azaltıyor gibi görünüyor ancak bu istatistiksel olarak anlamlı değil, bu da Türkiye'de emisyonu belirleyen temel değişkenin kömür olduğunu göstermektedir. Bu sonuç, yalnızca yenilenebilir yatırımı değil, aynı zamanda kömürden çıkış stratejilerinin gerekliliğini vurgulamaktadıur.

## 3.4 Results

The analyses conducted within the scope of this study reveal that between 2000 and 2022, the primary source of CO₂ emissions in Turkey has been electricity and heat production. The industrial sector stands out as the largest consumer of electricity, followed by residential and public services, which also account for significant portions of consumption. In contrast, electricity use and emissions in the agriculture and fisheries sectors have remained relatively stable.

Regression modeling indicated that per capita electricity consumption was a highly accurate predictor of CO₂ emissions (R² ≈ 0.97). A multivariate regression model projected that, with continued growth in production, CO₂ emissions could reach approximately 730 MtCO₂ by 2029.

Although the increasing share of renewable energy is a positive trend, it has not been sufficient to offset the overall growth in production. The time series analysis using the ARIMA(0,1,0) with drift model passed all residual diagnostics and forecasted a steady rise in production over the next decade. When compared to the ETS model, ARIMA delivered better performance with lower error margins. Based on the regression analysis linking total emissions to total electricity production and the share of renewables, future emission levels were estimated. These findings clearly indicate that, if current production and consumption patterns persist, CO₂ emissions are likely to continue rising.

# 4. Results and Key Takeaways

In our analysis, we examined the relationship between Turkey’s electricity production, the distribution of energy sources, and CO₂ emissions. We defined our data range as the last 20 years and used exploratory analysis, correlation studies, regression models, and time series forecasting methods. The key findings are as follows:

Electricity production in Turkey has been continuously increasing, and the rise in population and demand from the industrial sector has significantly contributed to the increase in CO₂ emissions.

Additionally, CO₂ emissions are strongly associated with electricity generation based on fossil fuels, especially coal. Our findings indicate that coal use in electricity production is still remarkably high in Turkey.

Although the use of renewable energy sources is growing day by day, this increase has not been sufficient to offset the rise in total electricity production and therefore has not had a significant effect on reducing emissions.

Both regression and time series models show that if current trends continue, CO₂ emissions will increase sharply in the coming years.

It is not enough to simply invest in clean energy sources. Although such investments have begun to grow in recent years, no downward trend in CO₂ emissions has been observed. Reducing the use of fossil fuels is essential.
